                   <p>This project aims to recreate a pixel perfect design and make a one-page responsive layout. This is also a beginner-level project that allows freshers to test their newly acquired knowledge and skill level. 

                    You can use the Conquer template to build this project. This template comes loaded with a host of unique layouts. Also, it brings before you a series of challenges that Web Developers often face in real-world scenarios. As a result, you are pushed to experiment with new technologies like Floats and Flexbox to hone the implementation of CSS layout techniques.</p>

                <p>This is a beginner-level project that is great for honing your JavaScript skills. In this project, you will design a website’s login authentication bar – where users enter their email ID/username and password to log in to the site. Since almost every website now comes with a login authentication feature, learning this skill will come in handy in your future web projects and applications.</p>

                <h2>Coding is Love</h2>
                <p>This project involves developing a web application that uses search inputs and Giphy API for presenting GIFs on a webpage. This is an excellent beginner-level project wherein you use the Giphy API to recreate the Giphy website. We recommend you to use the Giphy API since you need not request for any API key to use it. Another advantage of using the Giphy API is that you don’t require to worry about configuration while requesting data. 

                    You can use the Giphy API to build a web application that has a search input where users can search for specific GIFs, can display trending GIFs in a column/grid format, and has a load more option at the bottom for searching more GIFs.</p>

                <p>This web development project aims to create a JavaScript quiz game that can take multiple answers and show the correct result to users. While gaining JavaScript knowledge isn’t tricky, applying that knowledge in real-world scenarios is usually challenging. However, you can experiment with your skills by working on a small JavaScript-based quiz game. 

                    While building this project, you will not only deal with complex logic, but you will also learn a lot about data management and DOM manipulation. Depending on your JavaScript skills and ability to handle complex logic, you can make the game as simple or complicated as you want it to be</p>
